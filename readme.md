Real Torch by TenPlus1

This mod changed minetest torches so that they have a life of 8-10 minutes.

- coal lumps can be crafted into coal powder
- coal powder and an unlit torch can be crafted into a lit torch again
- punching an unlit torch with coal powder relights it
- water near torches make them drop as unlit torches
- coal powder can also be used for fuel or crafted into black dye
