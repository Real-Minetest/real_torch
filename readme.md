Real Torch by TenPlus1

This mod changed minetest torches so that they have a life of 8-10 minutes.

- coal lumps can be crafted into 4x coal powder
- coal powder and an unlit torch can be crafted into a lit torch again
- water near torches make them drop as unlit torches
- coal powder can also be used for fuel or crafted into black dye

Changelog:

- 0.1 - Initial upload
- 0.2 - Punching unlit torch with coal powder relights torch
- 0.3 - Torches are 2D and override any that are 3D
